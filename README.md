Key Features:

    Modular Development: Built in distinct phases, allowing for iterative testing and integration.
    ROS2-Native Control: Leveraging the latest ROS2 framework for robust and scalable robotic applications.
    Optimized Power Management: Custom power solutions for efficient and reliable operation of all onboard electronics.
    Scalable Architecture: Designed to easily integrate various sensors (Lidar, cameras, IMUs) for future autonomous capabilities.


 Project Phases & Development Branches:

    The project is structured into distinct phases, each managed within its own Git branch. This approach ensures modular development, easier debugging, and a clear progression of features.

   Phase 1: Serial Communication with Arduino (Base)
  
             Establishes fundamental serial communication between a ROS2 node on the host PC and an Arduino UNO controlling the PWM of two DC motors. 
             This phase ensures the basic control loop and hardware interfacing are functional.    

   Phase 2: ROS2 Twist_Keyboard Integration & Power System Upgrade
  
             Integrates the teleop_twist_keyboard package for differential drive control via keyboard input. This phase also includes significant power system upgrades: a 3S Li-ion battery pack with a 
             BMS, a dedicated XL4015 buck converter for the Raspberry Pi 5, and a Mini560 for fan and future servo power, ensuring robust and stable operation. |

   Phase 3 : ROS2 Twist_Joy Integration

              Integrates the teleop_twist_joy package for differnteial drive control via a gamepad or a joystick.
